# RAD Studio VCL Styles

![preview](preview.png)

## About

The user interface of RAD Studio 10.3 and onward has been upgraded to a new
flat look based on custom VCL styles. These styles were unavailable to end
users, so I have extracted them directly from the application's files.

## Install

Place the styles in `C:\Users\Public\Documents\Embarcadero\Studio\21.0\Styles`.
Restart RAD Studio if necessary.

## Changelog

- Cleaned Git history, packages, etc.

### 27 November 2018
